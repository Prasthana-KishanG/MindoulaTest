	|Physical Description| old retired nurse with a long history of hypertension that was previously well controlled on diuretic therapy. She was first admitted to CPMC in 1995 when she presented with a complaint of intermittent midsternal chest pain. Her electrocardiogram at that time showed first degree atrioventricular block, and a chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary congestion, with cardiomegaly. Myocardial infarction was ruled out by the lack of electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme abnormalities. Patient was discharged after a brief stay on a regimen of enalapril, and lasix, and digoxin,for presumed congestive heart failure. Since then she has been followed closely by her cardiologist.Aside from hypertension and her postmenopausal state, the patient denies other coronary artery disease risk factors, such as diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia or family history for heart disease. Since her previous admission, she describes a stable two pillow orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion after walking two blocks, and a mild chronic ankle edema which is worse on prolonged standing. She denies syncope,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or recent chest pains.|
